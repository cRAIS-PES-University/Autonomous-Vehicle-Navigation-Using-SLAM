# Autonomous-Vehicle-Navigation-Using-SLAM
The project on Autonomous Vehicle Navigation Using SLAM focuses on enabling vehicles to
navigate unknown environments by simultaneously building a map and determining their location
within it. By leveraging advanced SLAM algorithms, this work aims to develop robust navigation capabilities for autonomous vehicles, ensuring accurate localization and real-time mapping in
a static environment. 

The project involves implementing and benchmarking multiple 2D SLAM techniques—Cartographer, SLAM Toolbox, and RTAB-Map—on a TurtleBot3 Waffle in a Gazebo-simulated house environment. A comprehensive comparison of mapping quality is performed using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Intersection over Union (IoU) on the overlapping regions of generated maps. Additionally, CPU and memory usage are recorded using the ps command to evaluate the computational efficiency of each algorithm. The robot is manually driven using the ROS 2 teleop_twist_keyboard with two different linear velocities (0.15 m/s and 0.24 m/s) to gain insights into algorithm performance under varying conditions. To ensure fairness, all relevant topics (scan, odom, tf, tf_static, imu, clock) are recorded using ROS 2 bag and replayed identically across all SLAM algorithms. The resulting maps are saved and assessed for visual and quantitative quality. Furthermore, odometry drift is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the predicted odometry pose and an accurate AMCL-based pose estimate. These experiments provide valuable insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and resource demands of each SLAM approach in real-time autonomous navigation.
