# Autonomous-Vehicle-Navigation-Using-SLAM
The project on Autonomous Vehicle Navigation Using SLAM focuses on enabling vehicles to
navigate unknown environments by simultaneously building a map and determining their location
within it. By leveraging advanced SLAM algorithms, this work aims to develop robust navigation capabilities for autonomous vehicles, ensuring accurate localization and real-time mapping in
dynamic scenarios.
